Rock Paper Scissors

Write a Rock Paper Scissors game. The game can be instantiated with various
strategies. Below are two strategies for you to write, and an example of how
players interact with the game.

Strategy 1: Beat Their Last Move.

Here you will play the move that beats their last move.

Strategy 2: Beat Their Favorite.

Here you will play the move that beats their most frequent move.

Strategy 3: Extra Credit.

Come up with your own strategy if you have time.

Interacting with your game

The example below is a Ruby script, though feel free to use another language.

$ruby rps.rb favorite
You are playing against strategy 'favorite'.
Type 'r', 'p' or 's'.
>r
I chose 's'. You win!
you won 1 times.
you lost 0 times.
we tied 0 times.
Type 'r', 'p' or 's'.
>p
I chose 'p'. It's a tie!
you won 1 times.
you lost 0 times.
we tied 1 times.

Notes

Write tests for your implementation.
Focus on clean, clear code. Your code should exhibit strong Object Oriented
design. However, if you decide to pursue another design strategy, please
explain.
